Changes between versions 0.97 and 0.98.0 (TDB)
----------------------------------------------

- Added support for Java 8 constructs: default methods, method references,
  lambdas.

- Added hook to be run after updating tags table files.

- Using etags-goto-tag-location to improve precision in locating tags.

- Removed deprecated variables and methods.

- Droppped support for GNU Emacs 21.


Changes between versions 0.96 and 0.97 (2016-01-18)
---------------------------------------------------

- Added support for http URLs in jtags-browse-url. Configure a Javadoc URL to
  use for each group of packages, e.g. java or org.jdom.

- Only the Javadoc for the class found is displayed, not the entire Javadoc
  frame set with all packages and classes.

- Added support for Java enums.

- Improved Java code parsing.

- Made jtags more package-aware.

- Binding case-fold-search with let instead of setting it with setq.

- Using internal jtags-in-literal instead of c-in-literal.

- Changes to make jtags work with Emacs 24.5 and Java 8 source code.

- Changed license to GNU GPL version 3.


Changes between versions 0.95 and 0.96 (2008-10-03)
---------------------------------------------------

- Improved member completion: Members that are not visible in the current scope
  are now excluded from the list of matching members. Members in super classes
  are now included in the list, but are displayed using a different face (GNU
  Emacs). When completing a member in a class (and not an object), only static
  members are included in the list of matching members.

- Function jtags-show-declaration now stores a tag mark so it can be retrieved
  by etags function pop-tag-mark (M-*).

- Changed jtags to be an autoloadable minor mode - jtags-mode. Moved key
  bindings and menu to jtags-mode-map.

- Added support for Java 5 for loops.

- Added function jtags-buffer-tag-table-list to parse and return the tags table
  list.

- Added customization of the etags command run when updating tags tables files.

- Changed to jtags-save-buffer-state instead of c-save-buffer-state.

- Improved Java code parsing: packages.

- Improved tags table file parsing.


Changes between versions 0.94 and 0.95 (2008-02-01)
---------------------------------------------------

- Fixed "Unbalanced parentheses" bug. jtags-filter-class-list assumes that the
  point is in the class in case of scan error.

- When a local declaration shadows a class member, jtags now finds the local
  declaration instead of the class member.

- Split function jtags-lookup-member in two - jtags-lookup-identifier looks up
  the definition of an identifier, and jtags-lookup-class-members looks up all
  members in a class. This improves performance, and makes the code more
  readable.

- Added function jtags-update-this-tags-file that updates the tags table file
  in which the class in the current buffer is tagged. This makes it easy to
  update the outdated tags table file for the current project. The key sequence
  "C-c ," is bound to this function.

- Final and static members are displayed using a different face when doing
  member completion (GNU Emacs).

- Basic support for Java generics.

- Support for customization.

- Variable jtags-javadoc-root has been renamed to jtags-javadoc-root-list, and
  must be a list; a string value is not accepted.

- Update due to changes in the tags table file format in GNU Emacs 22.

- Improved Java code parsing: comments, packages, and generics.

- Generated frameset file now works in Mozilla Firefox.


Changes between versions 0.93 and 0.94 (2006-10-03)
---------------------------------------------------

- Ported to XEmacs (21.4.19).

- Added optional menu support using package easymenu.

- Added function jtags-update-tags-files that automatically rebuilds all tags
  table files in tags-table-list.

- Created two new functions for showing the declaration, and the Javadoc for a
  tag. Both of them use the old function jtags-find-tag, which now returns the
  definition of the tag.

- Member completion suggests only members that _start_ with the typed text.
  When undoing a member completion, the point is placed after the typed text.

- Possible to complete members in current class without specifying class name,
  e.g. "toStr" can be completed if class has a member "toString".

- Improved Java code parsing: arrays, package names, local variables, method
  arguments, class, super, this.

- Improved tags table file parsing: classes and interfaces, class members,
  member types.

- Removed run-time dependency to package cl to comply with the Emacs Lisp
  Coding Conventions.

- The Javadoc frameset file is created in a temporary directory instead of
  where the file jtags.el is.

- Moved all test code to file jtags-test.el.

- The function jtags-message prints to buffer *jtags* instead of *tmp*.


Changes between versions 0.92 and 0.93 (2002-02-27)
---------------------------------------------------

- The function tags-lookup-method now looks up interfaces as well as classes.


Changes between versions 0.91 and 0.92 (2001-09-10)
---------------------------------------------------

- The function jtags-message can now print debug messages to a buffer named
  *tmp*, as well as to the *Messages* buffer. Messages in the *Messages* buffer
  sometimes disappeared.

- The point is now placed after the inserted text after a completion. This is
  where you are most likely to continue typing after completing an identifier.

- Trying to complete a non-existing method now generates the message "No
  completion!" instead of an error message. jtags-find-member-completions now
  returns nil in this case.

- Completing methods in objects defined as local variables now works.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
